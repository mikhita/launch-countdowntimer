### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
I start with mobile-first workflow and finish mark-up in 5 hours intensive job, it was super good and responsible but I lost a lot of time doing the slider for large div, because I didnot know the what is regex function, but after I use that it was more easy to write the logic of function for eventlistener.

### What I learned

The more specific you are with your questions the more likely it is that another member of the community will give you feedback.
I learn also using regex and logic of creating slider.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.druckerhaus24.de/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69287466/regex-take-third-element-from-a-space-separated-list) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand regex. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
